				<p class="text">As the Lead Software Architect for my organization, I was at first hesitant on outsourcing and not being able to manage my developers myself.  However, after speaking with Alex and his team at EPC they were able to assemble a custom team to meet my specific needs when I needed it and were able to scale down when I did not.  It has allowed me to focus on bigger picture technical projects and growth while not having worry about the day to day.<br><span class="author-text"><span class="name"><span class="name-text">Antonio Perez</span> | Chief Software Architect</span> | <span class="company">Partsbase.com</p>

			<div class="second-testimonial">
				<p class="text">When I initially met with EPC to discuss my idea it was nothing more than a sketch on a napkin.  Fortunately their sharp leadership team instantly understood my vision and was able to pick it up and run with it. Within 5 months my platform was complete and at a cost and quality level that could not be matched by others.  I have since moved all of the software work for my other businesses to EPC.<br><span class="author-text"><span class="name"><span class="name-text">Jorge Alfaro</span> | Chief Technical Officer</span> | <span class="company">SeekingLeads.com</span></p>
