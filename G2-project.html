		<p>Marketingg2 (MG2) was a startup organization that was founded by Patrick Glennon, originally tried using an offshore firm from India, but were very unhappy with the results. EndPointConsulting (EPC) started working with MG2 as a database developer in 1996 and quickly proved itself and became their entire IT and database team.</p>

	<div class="cell-2">
		<p>From there we have worked together and the EPC team that now serves MG2 has grown from just 2 people to 9 full time consultants. EPC has been instrumental in building out the MG2 technology stack. Products we have worked on include: Open Intelligence, Solicitor Concierge, Subscriber Concierge, Touchpoint.</p>
